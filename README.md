# Create Audio Book from pdf
 A Pure-Python library built as a PDF toolkit. It is capable of:
extracting document information (title, author, â€¦)
splitting documents page by page
merging documents page by page
cropping pages
merging multiple pages into a single page
encrypting and decrypting PDF files
and more!
By being Pure-Python, it should run on any Python platform without any dependencies on external libraries. It can also work entirely on StringIO objects rather than file streams, allowing for PDF manipulation in memory. It is therefore a useful tool for websites that manage or manipulate PDFs.
